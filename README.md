# Project 3: Charitable Application

> “If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever.” — Kofi Annan

### The Problem

Our team believes that work done for no one's benefit is time wasted. The problem we've decided to focus on is the lack of resources to find meaningful projects for people to dedicate themselves to, so we decided to create a matching platform for volunteer experiences.

At this point, you may find yourself asking, _Why volunteer? Who still does that, anyway? What do I get out of it?_ And to that we quote Muhammad Ali for another nugget of wisdom on why we wanted to do what we did:

> "Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth."

You may not get paid for your hours, trust us, the fulfilment you get and the gratefulness of the people whom you've helped is more than enough for payment. Aren, one of the members of the team, has volunteered in three different countries and in several typhoon relief operations in her university, and she is a staunch believer in the good that comes from genuine volunteer work. Marc, the other half of the duo also thinks that volunteering is a way of giving back to the community.

After a few days of research, we were able to find a few reputable groups that have compiled a list of volunteer groups and NGOs, some of them have the projects categorized and have the application links right then and there; their system is robust and it works. There are already good systems in place. Okay, so if it ain't broke, why fix it?

### The Solution

This is where our app comes in. The app we've been working on is a platform to deliver better exchange experiences. Our definition of "better" is divided into 2 parts that contribute to our end goal:

1. If the volunteer can be matched to a project that is aligned with his skills. The experience is more enriching to a volunteer when he feels like his skills are used for the betterment of his target group.
    * If the volunteer feels happy with his experience, he will continue to volunteer in future projects. A KPI for the user side of our app is the times the user returns to volunteer (either for the first project, or other projects in the system.)
    * If the volunteer is also able to refer his friends/ colleagues/ whoever, then that would mean that our app is getting buzz. Even if people don't sign up themselves, we plan to integrate a platform for monetary donations in the future.
    * Eventually, we can probably add more features to monitor if we're actually making an impact -- maybe a way to check up on the volunteers to ask if they're enjoying the volunteer opportunity, or if they have any recommendations, maybe a direct messaging platform instead of a static contact form.

2. If the NGO or community can receive volunteers that are chosen to deliver better results (see KPI #3). For some opportunities, there should be preferred skillsets so that there would be less time needed to train the volunteers, and therefore more time to focus on the actual work.
      * A KPI for the client side of our app is an more of an intangible concept, but if the community feels satisfied with the efforts of the volunteers, then that's enough.
      * Another would be community engagement, meaning if this system gets eyes on the project, then an avenue to talk about these issues is opened up.
      * As stated above, this projects aims to get better results, which is a more tangible KPI. We use the term _better_ here to mean more goals reached, more engagement with the community, and better numbers across the board.


Basically, **happy volunteers => happy communities => returning volunteers => better experences for both parties.**

# This is where the technical part goes!!!

## Application Design

Demonstrate your ability to break down the problem and design a solution.

1. One page summary of your application including problem definition, solution. -- **DONE**
2. Determine the appropriate client technology, development tools, and platform for writing the UI -- **Maybe talk about why we chose React + React Redux + Whatever and then explain the folder structure and the special components maybe?**
3. Wireframes for at least 3 screens. **Marc**
4. User stories for the whole application. **Marc**
5. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). **Marc**

Tools and methodologies

1. Trello or similar project management tool to be used to track progress of build. **Maybe screenshots of the stuff we've worked on, maybe the Google Sheet (planning), and then this README on Dillinger? Hahahaha**
2. Show evidence of Slack conversations or use of other communication tools. **I wonder if there's a way to show how many messages we've sent hahahaha or maybe we can add a screenshot hahahahaha**
3. Code review. Demonstrate that you have had your code reviewed by other students and that you have provided a code review for others. **Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh**
4. Github. Demonstrate use of frequent commits, pull requests, documentation. **SO MANY DIFFERENT REPOS HAHAHAHA**
5. Provide evidence you have used code quality tools **So far I haven't used anything hahahahahaha**
